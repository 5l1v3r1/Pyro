Pyro -- A simple browser hooking server in python

Pyro was designed to be the simplest possible hooking server
to serve as a demonstation and a starting point for more serious
developement.

To start using Pyro you require no external packages! Most modern
python installations should work fine!

To run:
	./SimpleServer.py

Make sure that the hook.js and command.js is in the same path as Pyro.py
and if you'd like to use the hooktest.js make sure to place it there too.

Enjoy! and happy hooking!
